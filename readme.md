Welcome to the PLanetarium Git!

When developing a part of the game, make sure you branch of 'Master' before developing.

The 'Master' branch should be used for compilable code and the branches should allow you to develop your part of the software indpenently without disrupting anyone elses development.

Make sure you ALWAYS push your commits to GitHub so we all know it's at its latest state.

Also, makes sure to leave a detailed Commit comment so we know what's changed.

Cheers,
Dylan.
